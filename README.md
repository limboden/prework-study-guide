# <Your-Project-Title>

## Description

I, and probably many other students, found that there was a LOT of information given to us during the prework.
I needed a place to put all my notes so I could learn how to do that AND store information.
This way, I'm not scrambling over paper notes or random notes on .txt files. Now it's all very neat on a website that is accessible to me, and everyone. 
When the page is ran, in the console, it logs the basic topics we learned in the prework. It also selects a random one for the user to study. 
I learned how important it is to persist. There were some parts of the prework that didn't work for me and I didn't know why. I got frustrated and took the rest of the day off haha. 
I opened it again the next day, backtracked to figure out what was wrong, and solved the problem. I felt accomplished and satisfied. Never give up!


## Installation

You can simply download the project, and then open the index.html file using your default browser. Right click on it and select "Open in default browser" in VS code. 

## Usage

Open the html file in your favorite browser to look at my notes!
For suggestions on what to study first, open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows).
